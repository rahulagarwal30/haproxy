/* Principle of the wait queue.
 *
 * We want to be able to tell whether an expiration date is before of after the
 * current time <now>. We KNOW that expiration dates are never too far apart,
 * because they are already computed by adding integer numbers of milliseconds
 * to the current date.
 * We also know that almost all dates will be in the future, and that a very
 * small part of them will be in the past, they are the ones which have expired
 * since last time we checked them.
 *
 * The current implementation uses a wrapping time cut into 3 ranges :
 *   - previous : those ones are expired by definition
 *   - current  : some are expired, some are not
 *   - next     : none are expired
 *
 * We use the higher two bits of the timers expressed in ticks (milliseconds)
 * to determine which range a timer is in, compared to <now> :
 *
 *   now     previous     current      next0     next1
 * [31:30]   [31:30]      [31:30]     [31:30]   [31:30]
 *    00        11           00          01        10
 *    01        00           01          10        11
 *    10        01           10          11        00
 *    11        10           11          00        01
 *
 * By definition, <current> is the range containing <now> as well as all timers
 * which have the same 2 high bits as <now>, <previous> is the range just
 * before, which contains all timers whose high bits equal those of <now> minus
 * 1. Last, <next> is composed of the two remaining ranges.
 *
 * For ease of implementation, the timers will then be stored into 4 queues 0-3
 * determined by the 2 higher bits of the timer. The expiration algorithm is
 * very simple :
 *  - expire everything in <previous>=queue[((now>>30)-1)&3]
 *  - expire from <current>=queue[(now>>30)&3] everything where timer >= now
 *
 * With this algorithm, it's possible to queue tasks meant to expire 24.8 days
 * in the future, and still be able to detect events remaining unprocessed for
 * the last 12.4 days! Note that the principle might be extended to any number
 * of higher bits as long as there is only one range for expired tasks. For
 * instance, using the 8 higher bits to index the range, we would have one past
 * range of 4.6 hours (24 bits in ms), and 254 ranges in the future totalizing
 * 49.3 days. This would eat more memory for a very little added benefit.
 *
 * Also, in order to maintain the ability to perform time comparisons, it is
 * recommended to avoid using the <next1> range above, as values in this range
 * may not easily be compared to <now> outside of these functions as it is the
 * opposite of the <current> range, and <timer>-<now> may randomly be positive
 * or negative. That means we're left with +/- 12 days timers.
 *
 * To keep timers ordered, we use 4 ebtrees [0..3]. To keep computation low, we
 * may use (seconds*1024)+milliseconds, which preserves ordering eventhough we
 * can't do real computations on it. Future evolutions could make use of 1024th
 * of seconds instead of milliseconds, with the special value 0 avoided (and
 * replaced with 1), so that zero indicates the timer is not set.
