 * BUFSIZE defines the size of a read and write buffer. It is the maximum
 * amount of bytes which can be stored by the proxy for each session. However,
 * when reading HTTP headers, the proxy needs some spare space to add or rewrite
 * headers if needed. The size of this spare is defined with MAXREWRITE. So it
 * is not possible to process headers longer than BUFSIZE-MAXREWRITE bytes. By
 * default, BUFSIZE=16384 bytes and MAXREWRITE=BUFSIZE/2, so the maximum length
 * of headers accepted is 8192 bytes, which is in line with Apache's limits.
