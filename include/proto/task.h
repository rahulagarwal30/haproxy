/* Principle of the wait queue.
 *
 * We want to be able to tell whether an expiration date is before of after the
 * current time <now>. We KNOW that expiration dates are never too far apart,
 * because they are measured in ticks (milliseconds). We also know that almost
 * all dates will be in the future, and that a very small part of them will be
 * in the past, they are the ones which have expired since last time we checked
 * them. Using ticks, we know if a date is in the future or in the past, but we
 * cannot use that to store sorted information because that reference changes
 * all the time.
 *
 * So we cut the time in 3 ranges, only one of which <now> can be. The base of
 * the range holding <now> serves as a reference for as long as <now> remains
 * in this range :
 *   - previous : those ones are expired by definition (all before <now>)
 *   - current  : some are expired, some are not (holds <now>)
 *   - next     : none are expired (all after <now>)
 *
 * We use the higher two bits of the timers expressed in ticks to determine
 * which range a timer is in, compared to <now> :
 *
 *   now     previous     current      next0     next1
 * [31:30]   [31:30]      [31:30]     [31:30]   [31:30]
 *    00        11           00          01        10
 *    01        00           01          10        11
 *    10        01           10          11        00
 *    11        10           11          00        01
 *
 * By definition, <current> is the range containing <now> as well as all timers
 * which have the same 2 high bits as <now>, <previous> is the range just
 * before, which contains all timers whose high bits equal those of <now> minus
 * 1. Last, <next> is composed of the two remaining ranges.
 *
 * For ease of implementation, the timers will then be stored into 4 queues 0-3
 * determined by the 2 higher bits of the timer. The expiration algorithm is
 * very simple :
 *  - expire everything in <previous>=queue[((now>>30)-1)&3]
 *  - expire from <current>=queue[(now>>30)&3] everything where timer >= now
 *
 * With this algorithm, it's possible to queue tasks meant to expire 24.8 days
 * in the future, and still be able to detect events remaining unprocessed for
 * the last 12.4 days! Note that the principle might be extended to any number
 * of higher bits as long as there is only one range for expired tasks. For
 * instance, using the 8 higher bits to index the range, we would have one past
 * range of 4.6 hours (24 bits in ms), and 254 ranges in the future totalizing
 * 49.3 days. This would eat more memory for very little added benefit though.
 *
 * Also, in order to maintain the ability to perform time comparisons, it is
 * preferable to avoid using the <next1> range above, as values in this range
 * may not easily be compared to <now> outside of these functions as it is the
 * opposite of the <current> range, and <timer>-<now> may randomly be positive
 * or negative. That means we're left with +/- 12.4 days timers.
 *
 * To keep timers ordered, we use 4 ebtrees [0..3]. We could have used instead
 * of ticks, (seconds*1024)+milliseconds, as well as 1024th of seconds, but
 * that makes comparisons with ticks more difficult, so in the end it's better
 * to stick to the ticks.
 *
 * Another nice optimisation is to allow a timer to stay at an old place in the
 * queue as long as it's not further than the real expiration date. That way,
 * we use the tree as a place holder for a minorant of the real expiration
 * date. Since we have a very low chance of hitting a timeout anyway, we can
 * bounce the nodes to their right place when we scan the tree if we encounter
 * a misplaced node once in a while. This even allows us not to remove the
 * infinite timers from the wait queue.
 *
 * So, to summarize, we have :
 *   - node->key always defines current position in the wait queue
 *   - timer is the real expiration date (possibly infinite)
 *   - node->key <= timer
 *
 * The run queue works similarly to the wait queue except that the current date
 * is replaced by an insertion counter which can also wrap without any problem.
