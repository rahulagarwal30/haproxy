/*
 * Callbacks available on a filter:
 *
 *  - init                : Initializes the filter for a proxy. Returns a
 *                          negative value if an error occurs.
 *  - deinit              : Cleans up what the init function has done.
 *  - check               : Check the filter config for a proxy. Returns the
 *                          number of errors encountered.
 *
 *
 *  - stream_start        : Called when a stream is started. This callback will
 *                          only be called for filters defined on a proxy with
 *                          the frontend capability.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, any
 *                          other value otherwise.
 *  - stream_stop         : Called when a stream is stopped. This callback will
 *                          only be called for filters defined on a proxy with
 *                          the frontend capability.
 *
 *
 *  - channel_start_analyze: Called when a filter starts to analyze a channel.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *  - channel_analyze     : Called before each analyzer attached to a channel,
 *                          expects analyzers responsible for data sending.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *  - channel_end_analyze : Called when all other analyzers have finished their
 *                          processing.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait, any other value otherwise.
 *
 *
 *  - http_data           : Called when unparsed body data are available.

 *                          the number of consumed bytes.
 *  - http_chunk_trailers : Called when part of trailer headers of a
 *                          chunk-encoded request/response are ready to be
 *                          processed.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, any
 *                          other value otherwise.
 *  - http_end            : Called when all the request/response has been
 *                          processed and all body data has been forwarded.
 *                          Returns a negative value if an error occurs, 0 if
 *                          it needs to wait for some reason, any other value
 *                          otherwise.
 *  - http_reset          : Called when the HTTP message is reseted. It happens
 *                          when a 100-continue response is received.
 *                          Returns nothing.
 *  - http_reply          : Called when, at any time, HA proxy decides to stop
 *                          the HTTP message's processing and to send a message
 *                          to the client (mainly, when an error or a redirect
