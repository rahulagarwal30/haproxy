/*
 * The internal representation of an HTTP message is a contiguous array
 * containing both the blocks (htx_blk) and their contents. Blocks are stored
 * starting from the end of the array while their contents are stored at the
 * beginning.
 *
 * As data are sent to the peer, blocks and contents are released at the
 * edges. This free space is reused when no more space left. So blocks and
 * contents may wrap, not necessarily the same time.
 *
 * An HTTP block is as well a header as a body part or a trailer part. For all
 * these types of block, a content is attached to the block. It can also be a
 * mark, like the end-of-headers or end-of-message. For these blocks, there is
 * no content but it count for a byte. It is important to not skip it when data
 * are forwarded. An HTTP block is composed of 2 fields:
 *
 *     - .info : It a 32 bits field containing the block's type on 4 bits
 *               followed by content' length. See below for details.
 *
 *     - .addr : The content's address, if any, relatively to the beginning the
 *               array used to store the HTTP message itself.
 *
 * htx_blk.info representation:
 *
 *   0b 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
 *      ---- ------------------------ ---------
 *      type     value (1 MB max)     name length (header)
 *           ----------------------------------
 *                data length (256 MB max)
 *    (body, method, path, version, status, reason, trailers)
 *
 *   types:
 *     - 0000 = request  start-line
 *     - 0001 = response start-line
 *     - 0010 = header
 *     - 0011 = pseudo-header ou "special" header
 *     - 0100 = end-of-headers
 *     - 0101 = data
 *     - 0110 = end-of-data
 *     - 0111 = trailer
 *     - 1000 = end-of-message
 *       ...
 *     - 1101 = out-of-band
 *     - 1110 = error
 *     - 1111 = unused
