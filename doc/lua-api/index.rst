How Lua runs in HAProxy
=======================

HAProxy Lua running contexts
----------------------------

The Lua code executed in HAProxy can be processed in 2 main modes. The first one
is the **initialisation mode**, and the second is the **runtime mode**.

* In the **initialisation mode**, we can perform DNS solves, but we cannot
  perform socket I/O. In this initialisation mode, HAProxy still blocked during
  the execution of the Lua program.

* In the **runtime mode**, we cannot perform DNS solves, but we can use sockets.
  The execution of the Lua code is multiplexed with the requests processing, so
  the Lua code seems to be run in blocking, but it is not the case.

The Lua code is loaded in one or more files. These files contains main code and
functions. Lua have 6 execution context.

1. The Lua file **body context**. It is executed during the load of the Lua file
   in the HAProxy `[global]` section with the directive `lua-load`. It is
   executed in initialisation mode. This section is use for configuring Lua
   bindings in HAProxy.

2. The Lua **init context**. It is an Lua function executed just after the
   HAProxy configuration parsing. The execution is in initialisation mode. In
   this context the HAProxy environment are already initialized. It is useful to
   check configuration, or initializing socket connections or tasks. These
   functions are declared in the body context with the Lua function
   `core.register_init()`. The prototype of the function is a simple function
   without return value and without parameters, like this: `function fcn()`.

3. The Lua **task context**. It is an Lua function executed after the start
   of the HAProxy scheduler, and just after the declaration of the task with the
   Lua function `core.register_task()`. This context can be concurrent with the
   traffic processing. It is executed in runtime mode. The prototype of the
   function is a simple function without return value and without parameters,
   like this: `function fcn()`.

4. The **action context**. It is an Lua function conditionally executed. These
   actions are declared by the HAProxy directives "`tcp-request content lua
   <function>`", "`tcp-response content lua <function>`", "`http-request lua
   <function>`" and "`http-response lua <function>`". The prototype of the
   Lua called function is a function with doesn't returns anything and that take
   an object of class TXN as entry. `function fcn(txn)`

5. The **sample-fetch context**. This function takes a TXN object as entry
   argument and returns a string. These types of function cannot execute any
   blocking function. They are useful to aggregate some of original HAProxy
   sample-fetches and return the result. The prototype of the function is
   `function string fcn(txn)`. These functions can be registered with the Lua
   function `core.register_fetches()`. Each declared sample-fetch is prefixed by
   the string "lua.".

   **NOTE**: It is possible that this function cannot found the required data
   in the original HAProxy sample-fetches, in this case, it cannot return the
   result. This case is not yet supported

6. The **converter context**. It is an Lua function that takes a string as input
   and returns another string as output. These types of function are stateless,
   it cannot access to any context. They don't execute any blocking function.
   The call prototype is `function string fcn(string)`. This function can be
   registered with the Lua function `core.register_converters()`. Each declared
   converter is prefixed by the string "lua.".

HAProxy Lua Hello world
-----------------------

HAProxy configuration file (`hello_world.conf`):

::

    global
       lua-load hello_world.lua

    listen proxy
       bind 127.0.0.1:10001
       tcp-request content lua hello_world

HAProxy Lua file (`hello_world.lua`):

.. code-block:: lua

    function hello_world(txn)
       txn.res:send("hello world\n")
       txn:close()
    end

How to start HAProxy for testing this configuration:

::

    ./haproxy -f hello_world.conf

On other terminal, you can test with telnet:

::

    #:~ telnet 127.0.0.1 10001
    hello world

Fetches class
=============

.. js:class:: Fetches

  This class contains a lot of internal HAProxy sample fetches. See the
  HAProxy documentation for more information about her usage.

Converters class
================

.. js:class:: Converters

  This class contains a lot of internal HAProxy sample converters. See the
  HAProxy documentation for more information about her usage.

Channel class
=============

.. js:class:: Channel

  HAProxy uses two buffers for the processing of the requests. The first one is
  used with the request data (from the client to the server) and the second is
  used for the response data (from the server to the client).

  Each buffer contains two types of data. The first type is the incoming data
  waiting for a processing. The second part is the outgoing data already
  processed. Usually, the incoming data is processed, after it is tagged as
  outgoing data, and finally it is sent. The following functions provides tools
  for manipulating these data in a buffer.

  The following diagram shows where the channel class function are applied.

  **Warning**: It is not possible to read from the response in request action,
  and it is not possible to read for the request channel in response action.

.. image:: _static/Channel.png

.. js:function:: Channel.dup(channel)

  This function returns a string that contain the entire buffer. The data is
  not remove from the buffer and can be reprocessed later.

  :returns: a string containig all the avalaible data or nil.

.. js:function:: Channel.get_line(channel)

  This function returns a string that contain the first line of the buffer. The
  data is consumed. If the data returned doesn't contains a final '\n' its
  assumed than its the last available data in the buffer.

  If the buffer cant receive more data, a 'nil' value is returned.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :returns: a string containig the avalaiable line or nil.

.. js:class:: Socket

  This class must be compatible with the Lua Socket class. Only the 'client'
  functions are available. See the Lua Socket documentation:

  `http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/tcp.html
  <http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/tcp.html>`_

.. js:function:: Socket.close(socket)

  Closes a TCP object. The internal socket used by the object is closed and the
  local address to which the object was bound is made available to other
  applications. No further operations (except for further calls to the close
  method) are allowed on a closed Socket.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.

  Note: It is important to close all used sockets once they are not needed,
  since, in many systems, each socket uses a file descriptor, which are limited
  system resources. Garbage-collected objects are automatically closed before
  destruction, though.

.. js:function:: Socket.connect(socket, address, port)

  Attempts to connect a socket object to a remote host.

  Address can be an IP address or a host name. Port must be an integer number
  in the range [1..64K).

  In case of error, the method returns nil followed by a string describing the
  error. In case of success, the method returns 1.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: 1 or nil.

  Note: The function Socket.connect is available and is a shortcut for the
  creation of client sockets.

  Note: Starting with LuaSocket 2.0, the settimeout method affects the behavior
  of connect, causing it to return with an error in case of a timeout. If that
  happens, you can still call Socket.select with the socket in the sendt table.
  The socket will be writable when the connection is established.

.. js:function:: Socket.connect_ssl(socket, address, port)

  Same behavior than the function socket:connect, but uses SSL.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: 1 or nil.

.. js:function:: Socket.getpeername(socket)

  Returns information about the remote side of a connected client object.

  Returns a string with the IP address of the peer, followed by the port number
  that peer is using for the connection. In case of error, the method returns
  nil.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: a string containing the server information.

.. js:function:: Socket.getsockname(socket)

  Returns the local address information associated to the object.

  The method returns a string with local IP address and a number with the port.
  In case of error, the method returns nil.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: a string containing the client information.

.. js:function:: Socket.receive(socket, [pattern [, prefix]])

  Reads data from a client object, according to the specified read pattern.
  Patterns follow the Lua file I/O format, and the difference in performance
  between all patterns is negligible.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param string|integer pattern: Describe what is required (see below).
  :param string prefix: A string which will be prefix the returned data.
  :returns:  a string containing the required data or nil.

  Pattern can be any of the following:

  * **`*a`**: reads from the socket until the connection is closed. No
              end-of-line translation is performed;

  * **`*l`**: reads a line of text from the Socket. The line is terminated by a
              LF character (ASCII 10), optionally preceded by a CR character
              (ASCII 13). The CR and LF characters are not included in the
              returned line.  In fact, all CR characters are ignored by the
              pattern. This is the default pattern.

  * **number**: causes the method to read a specified number of bytes from the
                Socket. Prefix is an optional string to be concatenated to the
                beginning of any received data before return.

  If successful, the method returns the received pattern. In case of error, the
  method returns nil followed by an error message which can be the string
  'closed' in case the connection was closed before the transmission was
  completed or the string 'timeout' in case there was a timeout during the
  operation. Also, after the error message, the function returns the partial
  result of the transmission.

  Important note: This function was changed severely. It used to support
  multiple patterns (but I have never seen this feature used) and now it
  doesn't anymore.  Partial results used to be returned in the same way as
  successful results. This last feature violated the idea that all functions
  should return nil on error.  Thus it was changed too.

.. js:function:: Socket.send(socket, data [, start [, end ]])

  Sends data through client object.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param string data: The data that will be sent.
  :param integer start: The start position in the buffer of the data which will
   be sent.
  :param integer end: The end position in the buffer of the data which will
   be sent.
  :returns: see below.

  Data is the string to be sent. The optional arguments i and j work exactly
  like the standard string.sub Lua function to allow the selection of a
  substring to be sent.

  If successful, the method returns the index of the last byte within [start,
  end] that has been sent. Notice that, if start is 1 or absent, this is
  effectively the total number of bytes sent. In case of error, the method
  returns nil, followed by an error message, followed by the index of the last
  byte within [start, end] that has been sent. You might want to try again from
  the byte following that. The error message can be 'closed' in case the
  connection was closed before the transmission was completed or the string
  'timeout' in case there was a timeout during the operation.

  Note: Output is not buffered. For small strings, it is always better to
  concatenate them in Lua (with the '..' operator) and send the result in one
  call instead of calling the method several times.

.. js:function:: Socket.setoption(socket, option [, value])

  Just implemented for compatibility, this cal does nothing.

.. js:function:: Socket.settimeout(socket, value [, mode])

  Changes the timeout values for the object. All I/O operations are blocking.
  That is, any call to the methods send, receive, and accept will block
  indefinitely, until the operation completes. The settimeout method defines a
  limit on the amount of time the I/O methods can block. When a timeout time
  has elapsed, the affected methods give up and fail with an error code.

  The amount of time to wait is specified as the value parameter, in seconds.

  The timeout modes are bot implemented, the only settable timeout is the
  inactivity time waiting for complete the internal buffer send or waiting for
  receive data.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param integer value: The timeout value.

External Lua libraries
======================

A lot of useful lua libraries can be found here:

* `https://lua-toolbox.com/ <https://lua-toolbox.com/>`_

Redis acces:

* `https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua <https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua>`_

This is an example about the usage of the Redis library with HAProxy. Note that
each call of any function of this library can throw an error if the socket
connection fails.

.. code-block:: lua

    -- load the redis library
    local redis = require("redis");

    function do_something(txn)

       -- create and connect new tcp socket
       local tcp = core.tcp();
       tcp:settimeout(1);
       tcp:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379);

       -- use the redis library with this new socket
       local client = redis.connect({socket=tcp});
       client:ping();

    end
